<b>XSLT transformer</b> can be used to transform input files with a single static template. <br/>
List of options:
<ul>
    <li><b>Skip file on error</b> - if selected and transformation fail, then the file is skipped and the
        execution continues.</li>
    <li><b>File extension</b> - if provided then file extension in virtual path is set to given value.
        If no virtual path is set for some file then error message is logged and no virtual path is set.</li>
    <li><b>Number of extra threads</b> - How many additional workers should be spawn. Remember that higher
        number of workers may speed up transformation but will also result in greater memory consumption.
        This option should work better with files that takes longer to transform. One worker thread
        is always spawned even if the value is zero.</li>
    <li><b>XSLT template</b> - Template used during transformation.</li>
</ul>
