DPU takes HTML files as inputs and for each file generate a tree structure of statements based.
The root a of a tree is called ?rootSubject and is unique for each input file. Besides that every tree is located in it's own output graph (entry).
Tree structure is determined by used provided options.<br/>
Trees are generated by recursive application of actions on data objects (entities).
<br/><hr>
To given an example lets have following html page:<br/>
<code>
&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; <br/>
&lt;div&gt; <br/>
&lt;a href="link.html"&gt;My link&lt;/a&gt; <br/>
&lt;/div&gt; <br/>
&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; <br/>
</code>
Our task is to extract the value "link.html" from given html and store it as a object in output RDF statement.<br/><br/>

The input entity is called <em>webPage</em>. This entity represent the whole page. <br/><br/>

In first step we use action <em>QUERY</em> with <em>Action data</em> set to "a" (see table bellow for list of all actions).
This action takes input (<em>webPage</em>), execute given JSoup query (<em>Action data</em>) and put result to output entity. <br/><br/>

Let's call output entity <em>Link</em>. Now the content of <em>Link</em> is a single element <code>&lt;a href="link.html"&gt;My link&lt;/a&gt;</code> <br/><br/>

As a next step we extract a link (value of href attribute) from the <em>Link</em> element, for this we utilize action called
<em>ATTRIBUTE</em> with <em>Action data</em> set to "href". <br/><br/>

Again action do the transformation of given input entity to output, but this time output entity is a text - not an element as before. The text is equal to "link.html".
The difference between entity types (see table bellow for list of all used entity types) is important as we can not use for example <em>QUERY</em>
(JSoup query) with text entity as input (see table bellow for list of action input/output types).<br/><br/>

Now we can output the text as a object in RDF statement. To to this we use action <em>OUTPUT</em>. <em>Action data</em> of this action determine used predicate, in our case
we can use value "http://localhost/ontology/temp/link". This action has no output, instead it created a statement. <br/><br/>

As an object value of input text entity is used, as a predicate user <em>Action data</em> value is used.
But what about subject? Well each entity carry a URI of subject as a property and this is where the subject is taken from.
In our case as we haven't set this property to any value so default subject is used.

<strong>List currently supported types:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>element</strong> - a single HTML element, like &lt;a&gt; or &lt;div&gt; </li>
    <li><strong>list of elements</strong> - list of multiple elements</li>
    <li><strong>text</strong> - a text</li>

    <li><strong>subject</strong> - carried by each entity. A text representation of a subject URI.</li>

            Create new subject entity and store to given entities as a property. The value of subject is determined by DPU and can not be customized.<br/>
            Action data are used to determine predicate used to join new subject to old subject (?oldSub ?predicate ?newSub).
            If no predicate is given then default predicate is used (can be set on 'Advanced settings tab).

<strong>Advanced settings</strong>
<ul>
    <li>'Root subject class' - class of root subject.</li>
    <li>'Default has predicate' - used as a default <em>Action data</em> data for all <em>SUBJECT</em> actions</li>
