This DPU can be used to link data (perGraph-Input) to reference data (reference-Input), by asymmetric execution of given SPARQL construct.
<br/><br/>
List of inputs:
<ul>
    <li><strong>perGraph-Input</strong> - data to link.</li>
    <li><strong>reference-Input</strong> - data to link to.</li>
</ul>
The way in which the given SPARQL Construct is executed depends on <strong>per-graph option</strong>.
<ul>
    <li><strong>not checked</strong> - this DPU act as t-sparqlConstruct with per-graph unchecked.</li>
    <li><strong>is checked</strong> then following work flow is used: <br/>
        For each input graph (perGraph-Input) <em>G</em> and all reference graphs (reference-Input) <em>R</em>
        given SPARQL is executed over <em>G</em> unified with <em>R</em>.
    </li>
</ul>
