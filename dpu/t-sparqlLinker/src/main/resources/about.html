This DPU is designed to execute construct asymetrically on inputs.<br/>
List of inputs:
<ul>
    <li><strong>perGraph-Input</strong> - data to link.</li>
    <li><strong>reference-Input</strong> - data to link to.</li>
</ul>
Common usage is to link data (perGraph-Input) to reference data (reference-Input).
<br/>
If per-graph options is not checked then this DPU act as t-sparqlConstruct with per-graph unchecked.<br/>
If per-graph is <strong>not</strong> checked then following work flow is used: <br/>
For each input graph (perGraph-Input) <em>G</em> and all reference graphs (reference-Input) <em>R</em> given SPARQL is executed over <em>G</em> unified with <em>R</em>.
